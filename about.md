**About**:

I currently working in the area of Database Engines, Distributed Systems, and Parallel Computing.

Previously, I got the MS degree at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University. I researched some challenging problems (e.g., knowledge preserving, data bias, few-shot) of Machine Learning and Computer vision which are derived from the practical applications on Medical Image Analysis. I focused on Continual learning (or Incremental learning), exploring solutions to train Neural Networks continually.

My other interests include Digital Image Processing and Compiling Theory.
